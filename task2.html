        <h2>Magnavox Odyssey</h2>
        <p style="color: cyan;">
            The Magnavox Odyssey is the first commercial home video game console.
            The hardware was designed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates, while Magnavox
            completed development and released it in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following
            year.
            The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box that connects to a television set, and two rectangular
            controllers attached by wires.
            It is capable of displaying three square dots and one line of varying height on the screen in monochrome
            black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played.
            Players place plastic overlays on the screen to display additional visual elements for each game, and the
            one
            or two players for each game control their dots with the knobs and buttons on the controller in accordance
            with the rules given for the game.
            The console cannot generate audio or track scores. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money,
            and other board game paraphernalia to accompany the games, while a peripheral controller—the first video
            game light gun—was sold separately.

        <h2>Fairchild Channel F</h2>
        <p style="color: magenta;">
            The Fairchild Channel F, short for "Channel Fun", was the first video game console to use ROM
            cartridges, instead of having games built-in, and the first console to use a microprocessor.
            It was released by Fairchild Camera and Instrument in November 1976 across North America at a
            retail price of US$169.95 (equivalent to $772.92 in 2020).
            It was launched as the "Video Entertainment System", but when Atari, Inc. released its Video
            Computer System the next year, Fairchild rebranded their machine as "Channel F" while keeping the Video
            Entertainment System descriptor.
            The Fairchild Channel F achieved only about 350,000 units before Fairchild sold the technology to
            Zircon International in 1979, trailing well behind the VCS. The system was discontinued in 1983.

        <h2>Atari 7800</h2>
        <p style="color: #0cff0c;">
            The Atari 7800 ProSystem, or simply the Atari 7800, is a home video game console officially
            released by Atari Corporation in 1986 as the successor to both the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200.
            It can run almost all Atari 2600 cartridges, making it the first console with backward compatibility.
            It shipped with a different model of joystick from the 2600-standard CX40 and Pole Position II as the
            pack-in game. Most of the announced titles at launch were ports of 1980–83 arcade games.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #0cff0c;">
            Designed by General Computer Corporation, the 7800 has significantly improved graphics hardware over Atari's
            previous consoles, but the same Television Interface Adapter chip that launched with the 2600 in 1977 is
            used to generate audio.
            In an effort to prevent the flood of poor quality games that contributed to the video game crash of 1983,
            cartridges had to be digitally signed by Atari.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #0cff0c;">
            The Atari 7800 was first announced by Atari, Inc. on May 21, 1984, but a general release was shelved due to
            the sale of the company.
            Atari Corporation dropped support for the 7800, along with the 2600 and the Atari 8-bit family, on January
            1, 1992.

        <h2>TurboGrafx-16 / PC Engine</h2>
        <p style="color: #cfff04;">
            The TurboGrafx-16, known as the PC Engine outside North America, is a fourth-generation home video game
            console designed by Hudson Soft and sold by NEC Home Electronics.
            It was the first console marketed in the 16-bit era, although it used a modified 8-bit CPU.
            It was released in Japan in 1987 and in North America in 1989. In Europe, the console is known as the PC
            Engine; the Japanese model was officially imported and distributed in France in 1989, with unofficial PC
            Engine models making their way to the UK.
            In Japan, the system was launched as a competitor to the Famicom, but the delayed United States release
            meant that it ended up competing with the Sega Genesis and later the Super NES.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #cfff04;">
            The TurboGrafx-16 has an 8-bit CPU, a 16-bit video color encoder, and a 16-bit video display controller. The
            GPUs are capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512.
            With dimensions of just 14 cm × 14 cm × 3.8 cm (5.5 in × 5.5 in × 1.5 in), the Japanese PC Engine is the
            smallest major home game console ever made.
            Games were released on HuCard cartridges and later the CD-ROM optical format with the TurboGrafx-CD add-on.

        <h2>Sega Saturn</h2>
        <p style="color: #ff073a;">
            The Sega Saturn is a home video game console developed by Sega and released on November 22, 1994, in Japan,
            May 11, 1995, in North America, and July 8, 1995, in Europe.
            Part of the fifth generation of video game consoles, it was the successor to the successful Sega Genesis.
            The Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors.
            Its games are in CD-ROM format, and its game library contains several ports of arcade games as well as
            original games.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #ff073a;">
            Development of the Saturn began in 1992, the same year Sega's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware
            debuted.
            The Saturn was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi.
            Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming
            PlayStation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #ff073a;">
            The Saturn was initially successful in Japan but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after
            its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date.
            After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it
            was discontinued in 1998.
            Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure; the cancellation of
            Sonic X-treme, planned as the first 3D entry in Sega's popular Sonic the Hedgehog series, is considered a
            factor in its performance.
            The Saturn was succeeded in 1998 by the Dreamcast.

        <h2>Nintendo GameCube</h2>
        <p style="color: #ff5b00;">
            The Nintendo GameCube is a home video game console released by Nintendo in Japan on September 14, 2001, in
            North America on November 18, 2001, and in PAL territories in 2002.
            The GameCube was Nintendo's entry in the sixth generation of video game consoles and is the successor to the
            Nintendo 64.
            The GameCube competed with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #ff5b00;">
            The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium.
            The discs are in a miniDVD-based format, but the system was not designed to play full-sized DVDs or audio
            CDs unlike its competitors, and mainly focused on gaming instead.
            The console supports limited online gaming for a small number of games via a GameCube broadband or modem
            adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable, which allows players to access exclusive
            in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller like a Wii U.
            This allowed players to access features like the Tingle Tuner in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, among
            others.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #ff5b00;">
            Reception of the GameCube was mixed. The console was praised for its controller, extensive software library
            and high-quality games, but was criticized for its exterior design and lack of features.
            Nintendo sold 21.74 million GameCube units worldwide, much less than anticipated, before the console was
            discontinued in 2007.
            Its successor, the Wii, was launched in November 2006.

        <h2>PlayStation 3 (PS3)</h2>
        <p style="color: violet;">
            The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment.
            It is the successor to PlayStation 2, and is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles.
            It was first released on November 11, 2006, in Japan, November 17, 2006, in North America, and March 23,
            2007, in Europe and Australia.
            The PlayStation 3 competed primarily against Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh
            generation of video game consoles.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: violet;">
            The console was first officially announced at E3 2005, and was released at the end of 2006.
            It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its primary storage medium.
            The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, including the PlayStation
            Network, as well as the first to be controllable from a handheld console, through its remote connectivity
            with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita.
            In September 2009, the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released. It no longer provided the hardware
            ability to run PS2 games.
            It was lighter and thinner than the original version, and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design,
            as well as a minor start-up change in software.
            A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: violet;">
            During its early years, the system received a mixed reception, due to its high price ($599 for a 60-gigabyte
            model, $499 for a 20 GB model), a complex processor architecture, and lack of quality games but was praised
            for its Blu-ray capabilities and "untapped potential".
            The reception would get more positive over time.
            The system had a slow start in the market but managed to recover, particularly after the introduction of the
            Slim model.
            Its successor, the PlayStation 4, was released later in November 2013.
            On September 29, 2015, Sony confirmed that sales of the PlayStation 3 were to be discontinued in New
            Zealand, but the system remained in production in other markets.
            Shipments of new units to Europe and Australia ended in March 2016, followed by North America which ended in
            October 2016.
            Heading into 2017, Japan was the last territory where new units were still being produced until May 29,
            2017, when Sony confirmed the PlayStation 3 was discontinued in Japan.

        <h2>Wii U</h2>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
            The Wii U is a home video game console developed by Nintendo as the successor to the Wii.
            Released in late 2012, it is the first eighth-generation video game console and competed with Microsoft's
            Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
            The Wii U is the first Nintendo console to support HD graphics.
            The system's primary controller is the Wii U GamePad, which features an embedded touchscreen, directional
            buttons, analog sticks, and action buttons.
            The screen can be used either as a supplement to the main display or in supported games to play the game
            directly on the GamePad.
            The Wii U Pro Controller can be used in its place as a more traditional alternative.
            The Wii U is backward compatible with all Wii software and accessories.
            Games can support any combination of the GamePad, Wii Remote, Nunchuk, Balance Board, or Nintendo's Classic
            Controller or Wii U Pro Controller.
            Online functionality centers around the Nintendo Network platform and Miiverse, an integrated social
            networking service which allowed users to share content in game-specific communities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
            Response to the Wii U was mixed.
            It was praised for its innovative GamePad controller, improvements to online functionality over the Wii,
            backwards compatibility with Wii software and peripherals, and price; however, it was criticized for its
            user interface and functionality, and the GamePad's short battery life.
            It had low sales, primarily credited to a weak lineup of launch games, limited third-party support, and poor
            marketing including the lack of distinguishing the unique functionality of the GamePad from just being a
            tablet device for the Wii.
            Wii U production ended in January 2017.
            On March 3, 2017, Nintendo released its successor, the Nintendo Switch, which retained and refined concepts
            introduced with the Wii U.

        <h2>Xbox Series X and Series S</h2>
        <p style="color: #be03fd;">
            The Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S (collectively, the Xbox Series X/S) are home video game consoles developed by Microsoft.
            They were both released on November 10, 2020 as the fourth generation of the Xbox console family, succeeding the Xbox One family.
            Along with Sony's PlayStation 5, also released in November 2020, the Xbox Series X and Series S are part of the ninth generation of video game consoles.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #be03fd;">
            Rumors regarding the consoles first emerged in early 2019, with the line as a whole codenamed "Scarlett", and consisting of high-end and lower-end models codenamed "Anaconda" and "Lockhart" respectively.
            Internally, Microsoft had been satisfied with the two-console approach for the Xbox One, and planned a similar approach for the fourth generation Xbox, with the target for the high-end model to at least double the performance of the Xbox One X.
            The high-end model was first teased during E3 2019 under the title "Project Scarlett", while its name and design as Xbox Series X was unveiled during The Game Awards later in December.
            In September 2020, Microsoft unveiled the lower-end model as the Xbox Series S. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #be03fd;">
            The Xbox Series X has higher end hardware, and supports higher display resolutions (up to 8K resolution) along with higher frame rates and real-time ray tracing; it also has a high-speed solid-state drive to reduce loading times.
            The less expensive Xbox Series S uses the same CPU, but has a less powerful GPU, has less memory and internal storage, and lacks an optical drive.
            Both consoles are designed to support nearly all Xbox One games, controllers, and accessories, including those games from older Xbox consoles supported by Xbox One's backwards compatibility.
            At launch, Microsoft positioned their first-party games and several third-party games to be available for both Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One to help transition between generations, providing the "Smart Delivery" distribution framework to freely provide further optimizations of an Xbox One game for either the Xbox Series X or Series S.
            The consoles are also compatible with the gaming subscription service Xbox Game Pass, as well as the cloud game-streaming platform Xbox Cloud Gaming.

        <h2>PlayStation 5 (PS5)</h2>
        <p style="color: #fe019a;">
            The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment.
            Announced in 2019 as the successor to the PlayStation 4, the PS5 was released on November 12, 2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, with worldwide release following a week later.
            The PS5, along with Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Series S consoles were released in the same month, is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #fe019a;">
            The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs.
            The Digital Edition lacks this drive, allowing it to serve as a lower-cost model for those who prefer to buy games through digital download.
            The two variants were launched simultaneously. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: #fe019a;">
            The PlayStation 5's main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of 4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections, and the Tempest Engine allowing for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects.
            Other features include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback and backward compatibility with most of the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games.
